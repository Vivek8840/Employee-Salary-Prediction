# Employee Salary Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict employee salaries based on various features such as Age, Gender, Education Level, Job Title, and Years of Experience. A machine learning model, specifically **XGBoost Regressor**, is trained on a provided dataset (`Salary Data.csv`) to achieve this prediction.

The goal is to provide insights into salary trends and offer a tool for estimating potential salaries given a set of employee characteristics.

## Features

The model uses the following features for salary prediction:

* **Age:** Age of the employee.
* **Gender:** Gender of the employee (e.g., Male, Female).
* **Education Level:** Educational background (e.g., Bachelor's, Master's, PhD).
* **Job Title:** The employee's current job role.
* **Years of Experience:** Total years of professional experience.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model is `Salary Data.csv`. It contains historical data of employees with the above-mentioned features and their corresponding salaries.

**File:** `Salary Data.csv`

## Model Used

The core of this project is a machine learning model implemented using the **XGBoost Regressor** algorithm. XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is a powerful and efficient open-source library that provides a gradient boosting framework for C++, Python, R, Java, Scala, and Julia. It is known for its speed and performance, making it a popular choice for structured/tabular data.

A scikit-learn `Pipeline` is used to integrate preprocessing steps (like one-hot encoding for categorical features and standard scaling for numerical features) with the XGBoost regressor, ensuring that new data is transformed consistently before prediction.

## Setup and Installation

To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Vivek8840/Employee-Salary-Prediction.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Employee-Salary-Prediction.git)
    cd Employee-Salary-Prediction
    ```
    

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    It's good practice to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Install all required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## How to Run the Prediction Script

Once you have set up the environment and installed the dependencies, you can use the `predict_salary.py` script to make predictions:

```bash
python predict_salary.py
The script will prompt you to enter the required features (Age, Gender, Education Level, Job Title, Years of Experience), and then it will output the predicted salary.



Jupyter Notebook Walkthrough
The Employee-Salary-prediction-using-ml.ipynb notebook provides a detailed walkthrough of the entire machine learning pipeline:

Data Loading and Initial Exploration: Loading Salary Data.csv and performing initial checks.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and insights into the dataset.

Data Preprocessing: Handling categorical variables, scaling numerical features.

Model Training: Training the XGBoost Regressor.

Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like R2 Score, MAE, MSE, RMSE.

Model Saving: Saving the trained model for later use.

To run the notebook:

Bash

jupyter notebook
Then, open Employee-Salary-prediction-using-ml.ipynb in your browser.

Results and Evaluation
The notebook includes a section on model evaluation, presenting metrics such as:

R2 Score

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

A scatter plot comparing true values against predicted values is also generated to visually assess the model's performance.

Future Enhancements
Expand Dataset: Incorporate more diverse job titles, industries, and geographical data.

Feature Engineering: Explore creating new features from existing ones to improve model accuracy.

Hyperparameter Tuning: More rigorous hyperparameter optimization for the XGBoost model.
